This is my Road map to learning Deep Learning and Machine Learning technique from pure mathematics approachs  
Summary my road:  
  Week 1: Re-learning and Practice simple Python, Linear Regression approach by self learning technique   
  Week 2: Logistic Regression and simple NN model  
  Week 3: Application of NN model using sklearn, CNN model in visual analyse 
  Week 4: RNN model and LTSM model, application in stocks analysing
